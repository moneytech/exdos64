23 February, 2016		MTRR implementation, write-combining for framebuffer
24 February, 2016		PCI Express memory-mapped scanner
26 February, 2016		Fixed a bug in ATA driver, now doesn't hang on VirtualBox
3 March, 2016			Added legacy PIC support to be used when I/O APIC is not present
13 March, 2016			Made a boot screen
